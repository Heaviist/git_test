Hi There Internet World!

This is me doing things, I seem to be quite committed already.

See ya!

Adding some text to see what happens when committing without any messages. Wish me luck!

More lines, simply because we have tried to change the default editor for commit messages to VScode and now want to check if it actually works well.
